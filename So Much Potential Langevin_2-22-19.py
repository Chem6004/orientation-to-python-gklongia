### use cubic spline interpolation
order = 3
### form the interpolator object for the data
sE = InterpolatedUnivariateSpline(r_array, E_array, k=order)
### form a much finer grid
r_fine = np.linspace(1.06,5.0,200)
### compute the interpolated/extrapolated values for E on this grid
E_fine = sE(r_fine)
### plot the interpolated data
plt.plot(r_fine, E_fine, 'blue')

### minimum energy
minE = min(E_fine)

### take the derivative of potential
fE = sE.derivative()
### force is the negative of the derivative

### plot the forces
plt.plot(r_fine, np.abs(F_fine), 'black')

### Find index of the PES where it has its global minimum
r_eq_idx = np.argmin(E_fine)
### find the value of the separation corresponding to that index
r_eq = r_fine[r_eq_idx]
### print equilibrium bond-length in atomic units and in angstroms
print("Equilibrium bond length is ",r_eq," atomic units")
print("Equilibrium bond length is ",r_eq*0.529," Angstroms")

### get second derivative of potential energy curve... recall that we fit a spline to
### to the first derivative already and called that spline function fE.

### evaluate the second derivative at r_eq to get k
k = cE(r_eq)

### define reduced mass of CO as m_C * m_O /(m_C + m_O) where mass is in atomic units (electron mass = 1)
mu = 13625.

### define "ground-state" velocity:
v = np.sqrt( np.sqrt(k/mu)/(2*mu))

### get random position and velocity for CO within a reasonable range
r_init = np.random.uniform(0.75*r_eq,2*r_eq)
v_init = np.random.uniform(-2*v,2*v)

### print initial position and velocity
print("Initial separation is ",r_init, "atomic units")

### establish time-step for integration to be 0.02 atomic units... this is about 0.01 femtoseconds
dt = 0.02

### get force on particle 
F_init = -1*fE(r_init)

### parameters for Langevin Equation: temperature and drag
### note that in atomic units, the Boltzmann constant is unity
temperature = 0.00026 # boiling point of CO in atomic units
gamma = 0.01;

### use parameters set above to get initial perturbation of force for Langevin dynamics

    ### THE ABOVE IS EQUATION 6 IN THE ASSIGNMENT DAS POSTED
    
    ### update velocity for half time step, for such a small time step can approximate dv = adt
    ### THINK ABOUT IT: DO YOU REALLY HAVE TO DO THIS STEP?
    
   
    ### use current acceleration and velocity to update position
    ### WRITE CODE IMPLEMENTING THE FORMULA YOU OBTAINED, AS PART OF EXERCISE 1, FOR r(t+dt) HERE
    
    ### calculate the rp_future
    
    rp_fut = np.sqrt(2*temperature_val*gamma_val*mu/dt)*np.random.normal(0,1)
    
    ### use rp_fut to get future acceleration a_fut (a_tilde at the future time in the assignment), 
    ### note that we cannot take future drag into account as we have not calculated our future velocity yet
    ### CODE IMPLEMENTING EQUATION 7 IN THE ASSIGNMENT DAS POSTED GOES HERE
    
    ### use current and future acceleration to get future velocity v_fut
    ### note that we have to "correct" our formula relative to the formula for velocity Verlet
    ### as we have not included our future drag in our future acceleration

### how many updates do you want to perform?

### first BBK update

### plot the total energy vs. time: does the average energy seem to converge?
