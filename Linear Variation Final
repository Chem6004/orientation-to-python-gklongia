#Questions part 2 
#1 Is the energy you calculated above higher or lower than the ground state energy of the ordinary particle in a box system 
#(without the delta function potential)?

### The energy that was calculated was higher than the ground state energy of the ordinary particle in a box system. 

#2 Why do you think mixing in functions that correspond to excited states in the ordinary particle in a box system actually helped to 
#improve (i.e. lower) your energy in the system with the delta function potential?

### Mixing in functions that correspond to excited states in the ordinary particle in a box system actually helped to improve the energy in 
### the system since the energy of any approximate trial function is always above the true energy, then any variations in the trial function 
### which lower its energy are necessarily making the approximate energy closer to the exact answer. 

#3Increase the number of basis functions to 6 (so that ${\bf H}$ is a 6x6 matrix and ${\bf c}$ is a vector with 6 entries) and 
#repeat your calculation of the variational estimate of the ground state energy. Does the energy improve (lower) compared to what 
#it was when 3 basis functions were used?

### The energy of the 6 basis functions improves as compared to the energy when 3 basis functions were used.
